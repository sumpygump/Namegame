# Namegame

Your challenge this week is to create a lyrics generator for The Name Game song. It should accept any name and apply the rules of the song (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Name_Game#Rules). This isn’t quite as simple as it seems… I’ll be testing this against the 100 most popular male and female names in the U.S. in the last 100 years.

## Usage

This repository is the tests for the challenge.

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `composer update`
3. Run `vendor/bin/phpunit` to run the tests.

There are tests for 200 different names (taken from the top 100 names for males and females).
