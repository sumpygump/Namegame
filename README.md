# Namegame

Your challenge this week is to create a lyrics generator for The Name Game song. It should accept any name and apply the rules of the song (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Name_Game#Rules). This isn’t quite as simple as it seems… I’ll be testing this against the 100 most popular male and female names in the U.S. in the last 100 years.

## Usage

This repository is the tests for the challenge.

Clone the repo and run `phpunit` to run the tests.

This assumes you already have phpunit installed globally on your machine.

There are tests for 200 different names (taken from the top 100 names for males and females).
